					<h3>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3>
					<p>"Personal information" is defined as any information that can be used to identify an individual
						or contact them.</p>
					<p>While using our services, you may be asked to provide your personal information. WPI Lens and
						Lights ("LNL") and its partners/affiliates may use or share this information in accordance with
						this Privacy Policy in order to provide our services and/or evaluate and improve our
						performance.</p>
					<h4 class="pt-3">What personal information we collect</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>When you create an account as a client, we may collect a variety of personal information,
							including but not limited to, your first and last name, email address, phone number, and
							address or office location.</li>
						<li>When you create an account as an LNL member, we may collect your first and last name, email
							address, and class year, as well as any other information you voluntarily provide.</li>
						<li>When you log in with a WPI user account, we may collect personal information associated
							with the account, including but not limited to, the type of account, your name, email
							address, Student ID, class year, IP address, and geographical data (if applicable).</li>
						<li>When you update your profile, we may collect any additional information you choose to
							provide such as your nickname, cellular carrier, WPI Box number, or Radio MDC.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="pt-3">How we use your personal information</h4>
					<p>We may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with
						your consent, or at the request of local or federal law enforcement agencies.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We use your personal information to create your account, maintain your profile, and
							otherwise provide our services to you. We may also use your personal information for
							account and network security purposes or to provide technical support.</li>
						<li>If you have opted-in to receiving text messages from LNL, by selecting your cellular
							carrier when updating your profile, we may use this information to send you SMS text
							messages containing any relevant information with regards to your business with us. This
							method of communication will never be used for marketing purposes and you may opt-out at
							any time. Data and messaging rates may apply. Contact your carrier for more details.</li>
						<li>We may use your personal information to contact you about changes to your account or
							booking(s) and to send you important notices about updates to our service agreements and
							policies. You may not opt-out of these communications.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="pt-5">
					<h3>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h3>
					<p>We also collect data in a form that, on its own, cannot be used to identify you ("anonymous
						data"). We may collect, use, store, and disclose anonymous data for any purpose.</p>
					<p>Here are some examples of the types of anonymous data we typically collect and how we might use
						it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>When you visit our website, you consent to the use of cookies, and we may collect and store
							information such as your browser type or version, device identifiers, location, language,
							and the pages you visit. We may also combine this data with anonymous personal information,
							such as your age and gender, in a way that cannot be used to personally identify you, in
							order to conduct research and perform assessments on how our services are doing and learn
							about ways we can improve them.</li>
						<li>When you set up a new organization, we may collect details about your organization, such as
							its name, primary contact, and billing information. This information is used solely for the
							purpose of providing our services to you and will never be shared with third parties.</li>
						<li>When you book an event, we may collect details about your event, such as the event name,
							location, schedule, requested services, and any additional resources such as floor plans or
							audio/video files that you provide. This information is primarily used to provide our
							services to you and may be shared with third-party service providers, when necessary. We
							may also use this information when conducting research or performing assessments on our
							services, in order to learn about ways to improve them.</li>
						<li>We may collect and store information regarding how you use our services, including search
							queries. This information may be used to improve our services or report trends to our
							partners and affiliates.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We may share anonymous data with online service providers (such as Google Analytics) in order to
						help us provide the best quality of service possible. For more information regarding how these
						parties handle your data you can review their policies below:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="pt-5">
					<h3>Third Parties</h3>
					<p>From time to time, we may share some of your personal information with third parties in order to
						provide our services. Your personal information will never be shared with third parties for
						marketing purposes. Anonymous data collected for analytics purposes may be shared with our
						online service providers or affiliates assuming the information is presented in a form that
						cannot be used to identify you.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="pt-5">
					<h3>Media and Copyright</h3>
					<p>While providing our services, or during LNL business or social gatherings (referred to as
						"sponsored events"), LNL members may occasionally photograph, videotape, and/or record portions
						of the event. Unless indicated otherwise, when you book an event or attend an LNL sponsored
						event, you agree that such images, videos, and/or recordings will remain the property of LNL
						and may, at any time, be used on LNL's website, social media, and/or promotional or
						informational materials including, but not limited to, flyers, brochures, newsletters, and
						advertisements. If instead you would prefer that LNL and/or your guests refrain from
						photographing or recording portions of your event, please let us know by emailing
						<a href="mailto:lnl@wpi.edu">lnl@wpi.edu</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="pt-5">
					<h3>Data Retention and Access</h3>
					<p>By default, any data collected through the LNL website for business purposes is retained
						indefinitely. This includes any personal information you may have provided LNL when booking an
						event or updating your profile. Information collected through all other means will only be
						retained for as long as it is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy. When
						determining how long to retain your data we carefully consider whether or not there is good
						reason for doing so, and if there is, we will only retain it for the shortest possible period
						to serve that purpose unless a longer period is required by law.</p>
					<p>For any personal information we retain, we will give you access (and provide a copy) for any
						purpose, including to request that we correct inaccuracies or delete the data if we are not
						required to retain it for the purposes described above. We may decline to process requests that
						are frivolous, impractical, jeopardize the safety or privacy of others, or for which access is
						not otherwise required by local law. You can submit a request for the correction or deletion of
						your data by emailing <a href="mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu">lnl-w@wpi.edu</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="py-5">
					<h3>Questions</h3>
					<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding the privacy of your data, or you would like to
						submit a request to update or delete your personal information, send an email to our webmaster
						at: <a href="mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu">lnl-w@wpi.edu</a>.</p>
					<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time as we make changes to our services or
						website. When we make significant changes, we will place a prominent notice on our website and
						send an email to the address we currently have on file for you.</p>
