	<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
	<p>We are Lens and Lights, a WPI club which provides quality lighting, sound, and projection services to the WPI campus and surrounding area. We are a group of very passionate individuals who are extremely passionate about what we do!</p>
	<h2>Membership Requirements:</h2>
	<p>An active member needs to actively participate in five events in three of the areas listed below. Attendance to three consecutive meetings is also required (unless otherwise arranged). These requirements must be completed within a single semester. Having all these requirements does not necessarily mean that a member will be automatically activated; each activation will be decided on an individual basis by the executive board. It is also preferable to have worked at least one L3 or S3 before being activated. Active members are eligible to crew chief events, receive an LnL identification card, and can vote in club affairs.</p>

A good knowledge of electronics and electricity, as well as a good knowledge of audio and lighting equipment are traits found in the TD. Also, the TD typically knows which end of the soldering iron to hold, but still manages to burn themself.</p>
