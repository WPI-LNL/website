            <h1>About Lens and Lights</h1>

            <p />
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are Lens and Lights, a WPI student organization which provides quality lighting, sound, and projection services to the WPI community. We are a group of very passionate individuals who are interested in working with production equipment and advancing the WPI community.</p>

<h2>To On-Campus Organizations</h2>
<p>Do you want to be seen and heard by the masses in your event? Bring in Lens and Lights! We specialize in mobile lighting and sound, from a simple spotlight or microphone to full-stage setups. We also have a theater with high quality film and digital projection capacity. For information, contact our <a href="mailto:lnl-vp@wpi.edu">Vice-President</a> or check out the online workorder form above.</p>

<h2> To Interested Students </h2>
<p>Want to work with high-quality equipment and become a driving force in getting things done on campus? Join LNL! We encourage you to stop by and chat or help out at any of our <a href="/list">events</a>. You can also pop by in one of our general body meetings, every Wednesday at 5PM in AK233, or visit our office on the third floor of the campus center.</p>

<p>Associate members need only help at an event for activation. An active member needs to participate in five events of at least 3 types (see our price list). Attendance one of the two meetings each week for three consecutive weeks is also required for full activation unless otherwise arranged. It is also recommended to have worked at least one L3 or S3 before being activated to get the full LNL experience. Active members are eligible to crew chief events and can vote in club affairs.</p>
