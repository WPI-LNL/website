					<h3 class="alert-heading">In Brief:</h3>
                    Starting in July 2025, LNL will be increasing prices in order to adjust for rising inflation, increasing equipment upkeep costs, and to facilitate the replacement of outdated equipment. This will be our first price increase in over 14 years. 
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>Why change prices now?</h3>
                <p>
                    When LNL last adjusted the pricing structure of our services in 2019, the cost of LNL services decreased on average. Prices were last increased in 2011, and since then, our services and equipment have dramatically changed. With our existing prices, LNL can no longer continue to afford the repair or replacement of our increasingly aging equipment. Because of this, LNL has decided to increase prices starting in July 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the last decade, our focus has been on repairing and extending the life of our equipment, often far past the expected end-of-life. However, we are now faced with an aging inventory, and several pieces of expensive equipment will need replacement in 2-4 years. Our existing pricing structure is long outdated, and we will be unable to cover these expenses when equipment requires replacement. Our new pricing keeps our services as affordable and accessible as possible while taking these anticipated costs into account. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be frank, we don’t take this matter lightly and we understand that the price adjustment will be significant, especially for organizers of large events. We have been working on these changes for over 2 years, pushing back the announcement many times to allow for refinement and the integration of feedback from SAO and SGA. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are here to support all event organizers on campus with the transition to our new pricing and we don’t want the increased cost to become a barrier. For the upcoming academic year (2025-26), we’re open to offering significant discounts to alleviate budgeting challenges. For events funded by student organizations, we’ve discussed the price increase with SGA, and they are expecting an increased cost for LNL services in Funding Requests and budgets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above all, we’re excited to continue supporting the events that bring our community together. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:lnl@wpi.edu" target="_blank">lnl@wpi.edu</a> with any questions or requests for cost estimates. Throughout the next year, we would especially like to hear your honest feedback as we adjust to this change and continue to improve our communication and event services. 
                </p>
                <div class="alert alert-dark">
                <h3 class="alert-heading">Why does LNL charge for event services?</h3>
                <p>
                    LNL charges for our services so that we are able to repair, maintain, and replace the equipment we use to provide services to campus events. LNL is entirely a volunteer organization. We do not charge for labor or our members' time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Financially, LNL operates differently than most student organizations at WPI. We do not receive an annual budget from SGA or WPI for maintaining our event equipment.  
                </p>
                <hr>

				<div class="alert alert-dark">
					<h3 class="alert-heading">How are LNL prices and services changing?</h3>
					<p>
						Our overall goal with price changes was to make small increases for small events and more significant increases for large events with advanced technical needs.
					</p>

					<a class="collapse-btn btn btn-secondary collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#prices-and-services-changing-1"></a>
					<div class="collapse alert alert-dark" id="prices-and-services-changing-1">
						<p>
							The size and scope of large events at WPI has greatly increased over the last 4 years. As our event services increased in scope, our prices remained constant. This led to a discrepancy between the event price and the cost of maintaining new, advanced equipment.
						</p>
						<p>
							With existing prices, the cost of our services for large events was consistently less than 10% of any external provider.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Because of this, large and technically complex events will see the largest change in our prices; however, we will still charge significantly less than an external provider would. See price comparison for details.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>In addition, some production services have been adjusted to account for different equipment and new services.</p>
					<a class="collapse-btn btn btn-secondary collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#prices-and-services-changing-2"></a>
					<div class="collapse alert alert-dark" id="prices-and-services-changing-2">
						<p>Discounts and fees:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All events that are funded by student organizations (via SGA or fundraising) will receive a 10% student discount for our services.&nbsp;</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Lighting:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We added more granular options for complexity and size of lighting. This will help to keep the prices low for smaller events while allowing us to offer more options for larger events.&nbsp;</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Sound:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Input Categorization</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Audio inputs are microphones or other audio sources (DJ, laptop, etc). &nbsp;</li>
								<li>The number of inputs in each category (Small, Medium, Large) was increased to fit our updated equipment and the needs on campus.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>Many events that previously needed large inputs now will be quoted with medium inputs, reducing cost for small events.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Speaker Categorization</li>
							<ul>
								<li>We added another category of speakers to make three options: Small, Medium and Large. This will help to keep the prices low for smaller events while allowing us to offer more options for larger events.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Wireless Microphones</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Wireless microphones have an additional charge because they cost more to maintain than wired microphones (e.g. batteries and frequent damage).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
								<li>We have switched away from individual wireless mic pricing to a “package system” based on the equipment that is used: <em>Small Wireless Mics Package</em> includes 4 mics, <em>Medium Wireless Mics Package</em> includes 8 mics, and <em>Large Wireless Mics Package</em> includes 40 mics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
								<li>There will still be an option to add individual wireless mics as an add on to a wireless mic package.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Stage Monitors</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Stage Monitors are speakers pointed at the stage or performance area. They are needed so the performers can hear themselves while performing.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>We now offer two levels of stage monitors:<em> Small Stage Monitors</em> for a single audio mix (appropriate for dancers, soloists and small live music performances) and <em>Large Stage Monitors</em> for multiple audio mixes (appropriate for most live music performances).&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Audio Recording</li>
							<ul>
								<li>We’ve offered <em>Multitrack Recording</em> for a while, and we also now offer <em>Stereo Recording</em> at a lower cost.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							</ul>
							<p>Rigging:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The category of rigging is based on the truss sections and motors needed to support the lighting, sound, and video services.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>The rigging category names have been updated to <em>Small Truss Rigging</em> and <em>Large Truss Rigging</em> to match the rest of the price list.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>We increased the truss sections in <em>Small Rigging </em>from one section to two sections since two sections is very common. This allows more events to be categorized as <em>Small Rigging</em>.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>We also separated <em>Rigging Towers, </em>16-foot towers that can support truss or fixtures, into their own category.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Video:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>We have vastly improved our video and projection capabilities in recent years. We have created several categories of services to better support these requests and quote video services consistently.&nbsp;</li>
								<li>We now own a variety of projection equipment to support these video services that we have not previously charged for and need to be able to maintain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
					</div>
					<p>To avoid another significant price change in the future, our prices will start adjusting annually proportionally to the CPI (Consumer Price Index) to compensate for inflation. For events funded by student organizations, SGA has indicated that inflation adjustments can be included in annual club budgeting, including inflation-based price adjustments of LNL services. Please reach out to SGA at sgatreasurer@wpi.edu with any questions regarding club budgets or Financial Requests (FRs). </p>

					<h3 class="alert-heading">Why are LNL prices increasing?</h3>
					<p>
						LNL’s prices have not increased since 2011. We reorganized and recategorized our services in 2019, but the average cost of an event decreased. While our prices remained constant, the landscape of event production equipment has changed significantly. As equipment has digitized, it has become an order of magnitude more expensive to buy and repair.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Our buying power has decreased to a point where, broadly speaking, we’re able to maintain and repair what we have, but we can’t afford to replace equipment when it reaches the end of its life. Our new prices are based on estimates of what equipment we expect will need replacing in the next 2-4 years. 
					</p>
					<p>
						LNL services have greatly expanded since our prices last changed as we have worked to adapt our capabilities to meet the needs of WPI events.

				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-dark">
					<h3 class="alert-heading">Why does LNL ask SGA for additional funding (i.e. submit SGA Funding Requests)? </h3>
					<p>
						LNL spends funds to maintain and repair equipment used for current services, replace equipment as it reaches end-of-life, and make incremental equipment upgrades to meet new needs of campus events. Our prices were designed to maintain the equipment needed for our current services. To keep our prices low, LNL does not charge enough to completely fund large equipment upgrades that significantly change our capabilities.  
					</p>
					<p>
						When campus events make requests beyond LNL capabilities, we often coordinate external equipment rentals. When we notice that many events are requesting the same rental equipment, we then look into purchasing similar items to avoid recurring rental costs. SGA has previously been open to LNL requesting SGA funds (FRs) to expand our capabilities. Historically, LNL has contributed by partially funding the request and asked SGA to assist with the remainder. We do not have plans to ask SGA to fund any new capabilities in our sound or lighting services in the near future.

						Below is a summary of SGA FRs in the past 4 years.

					<h3 class="alert-heading" id="projection">SGA supports LNL Film & Digital Projection</h3>
					<p>
						Since 1989, LNL has provided film projection services in Fuller Perrault Hall (and before then, we provided projection services in Alden Hall and Salisbury 115). Nowadays, we provide digital, 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm film projection services for weekend movies, special events, and film screenings. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Financially speaking, projection services in the Fuller Upper Booth operate separately from the rest of the club. LNL has received funding directly from the student life fee to maintain our projectors and supporting equipment. Projection funding is separated into a different WPI Workday fund (worktag) and is not used to support LNL event services.

						For organizations with SGA budget line items for LNL services, an FR will be needed for each event with an increased price. To make SGA Funding Requests (FRs) for budgeted events as easy as possible, we created a template form response, breakdown spreadsheet, and presentation with details prefilled based on SGA’s templates.

						For a small event quote, please <a href="https://outlook.office.com/mail/deeplink/compose?to=lnl@wpi.edu">email LNL at lnl@wpi.edu</a> more than 2 weeks in advance, and for a large event quote, 6 weeks in advance. We need a date, location, and event specifics to provide a quote (and SGA informed us that they would generally like to see a quote before approving an FR).
