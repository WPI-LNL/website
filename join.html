						<h2>Lighting</h2>
						<p>
							LNL provides lighting for a variety of events with our inventory of
							professional grade equipment. We illuminate all sorts of events including
							full on dance parties, stage performances, live
							bands, receptions, outdoor gatherings, and large robotics
							competitions! The equipment we own includes a variety of
							conventional, LED, and arc lamp fixtures which enable our members to be
							creative in their lighting design! Highlights include several pairs of moving head spot
							and LED wash fixtures, wireless uplights, and
							over 100 conventional Source Four fixtures. We also have a variety of
							lighting consoles to control them, ranging from small analog
							consoles to large and complex consoles in the EOS and HOG families.
							Now if all that sounds like a bunch of jibberish, come help out at
							one of our events and we will be happy to explain everything. We also
							encourage you to checkout our upcoming workshops!

					<div class="col-lg mb-3">
						<h2>Sound</h2>
						<p>
							Lens and Lights does numerous sound events on campus! They
							range from smaller events like providing a wireless microphone for a
							speaker, to a Capella shows and music on the quad, to full blown
							robotics competitions like BattleCry at WPI. We have several
							different speakers, mics, consoles and more which we use to create the best
							event possible! If you've ever been interested in learning how sound can go
							from a device like your phone out to some of these larger speakers, feel free to stop
							by a sound event and we will show you the ropes (...and the cables)!

					<div class="col-lg mb-3">
						<h2>Projection</h2>
						<p>
							LNL maintains several projectors on campus, capable of showing theatre
							quality, full-length feature films. Our digital projector is used to
							show Soccomâ€™s weekend films in the Fuller Upper Perreault Hall. We
							also maintain two 35/70mm film projectors that are more than 50 years old.
							Members can be trained on each of these projectors, starting with
							one of our two 16mm projectors and working their way up through the larger formats.
							Setup for weekend movies typically happens at 7:30pm on Saturdays and Sundays.
							Come say hello and learn about the fun that is projection. It's a
							reel-y good time!
