		LnL has been providing sound reinforcement to the WPI community since the early 1970s. 
		Whether you need a microphone for a single presenter in the Odeum, or an entire concert 
		PA for a professional band, LnL has the equipment, personnel, and technical expertise 
		necessary to make your event both affordable and successful.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All of our speakers are manufactured by Eastern Acoustic Works (EAW) and are typically organized 
		by the size of the event they are suitable for. However, for larger events like the WPI FIRST 
		Robotics Regional and BattleCry, more speakers are needed. For events like these we will often 
		use all of the speakers in our inventory.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Large Events</h2>
	
	<p>
		For large events such as concerts and other professional performances you may have seen 
		in Alden Memorial, Harrington Auditorium or on the Quad, we use:
	</p>
		<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
			<li>4 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/KF850zF">KF850s</a> - 
		
			According to EAW, the “KF850 Series loudspeakers are the
			world touring standard, accepted in more technical riders than any other loudspeaker.”</li>
			
			<li>4 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/SB1000z">SB1000s</a> - Large subwoofers</li>
			<li>6 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/docs/2_Legacy_Products/Loudspeakers/SM/SM200iH/SM200iH_SPECS_rev2.pdf">SM200iH</a> for monitors, which allow “professional musicians and 
			the audio professionals who support them the ability to customize on-stage monitor systems 
			to the needs of the performing ensemble and venue.” </li>
			<li><a href="http://www.allen-heath.com/uk/Products/Pages/DiscontinuedProductDetails.aspx?productId=GL4000">Allen and Health GL4000</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/sr56-8/index.html">Mackie SR40-8</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.yamahaproaudio.com/products/mixers/ls9/features.html">Yamaha LS9-32</a></li>
		</ul>	
	
	
	<p>
		The KF850s and SB1000s are tuned with a <a href="http://www.eaw.com/UX8800">
		UX8800 processor</a> that EAW claims “no other rack-mounted digital processor can approach … 
		in terms of dramatically advancing current and future EAW loudspeaker performance” and are 
		powered by <a href="http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/140318.pdf">Crown I-T4000 and I-T8000 amplifiers</a>. 
		This setup allows us to remotely monitor our speakers and ensure that nothing can be over-driven, providing clean 
		and powerful sound without any distortion.
	</p>
		
	<h2>Medium and Small Evnets</h2>
	<p>
	For smaller events than those described above, we have the following equipment available 
	from EAW’s LA Series, which “brings together professional components and rugged construction 
	with EAW's total system engineering to create compact, portable loudspeakers ideally 
	suited to small venue live performance” 
	</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
		<li>4 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/LA325">LA325s</a></li>
		<li>2 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/LA128z">LA128s</a></li>
		<li>2 <a href="http://www.eaw.com/LA215">LA215s</a>, often seen in the Goat's Head</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	These speakers are powered by <a href="http://www.qscaudio.com/products/amps/plx2/plx3602_specifications.htm">QSC PLX3602</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.qscaudio.com/products/amps/plx/plx.htm">PLX3402</a> amplifiers, 
	and are perfect for small bands and acoustics. They will pleasantly fill a small venue 
	very easily and are powerful enough to handle events in Alden as well. We also use the 
	<a href="http://www.allen-heath.com/UK/Products/Pages/ProductDetails.aspx?CatId=MixWizard3Series&amp;ProductId=MixWizard3162">Allen and Heath Mixwizard3 16:2</a> mixer for these kinds of events.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When it comes to microphones for any event we use the industry standard 
	<a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone">Shure SM58</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm57-instrument-microphone">SM57</a>. 
	We also have many other professional microphones available. A few of these are listed below:
	</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
		<li><a href="http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/mp/microphones/vocals-and-instruments/stage-vocals/wired-microphones/m-88-tg.html">Beyerdymanic M-88</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,261,pid,261,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html">AKG D112</a> for kick-drums</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm81-instrument-microphone">Sure SM81</a> condenser microphones</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	This only covers some of our inventory, as we have enough to handle any event necessary. 
	We also have a full suite of four high end wireless microphones for your convenience. 
	Whether you require a handheld or a headset, we can provide the mobility you need for your event.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This huge selection of equipment makes it possible for us to provide high quality 
	sound virtually anywhere on campus. We can accommodate demanding shows with professional 
	equipment and technical knowledge. We are able to support even the busiest times of the year 
	(NSO, Homecoming, Parents Weekend, Quadfest, etc.) by providing up to 5 live systems at 
	the same time. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding how we provide this 
	service. We would love to work with you to figure out how we can make your event as 
	successful and affordable as possible.
